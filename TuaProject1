      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins. I was born and raised in Hawaii. I left Hawaii in 2017 to attend the University of Alabama, where I would become their starting quarterback. After 3 years, I declared for the NFL draft and was picked 5th overall by the Miami Dolphins in 2020.</p>

      <h2>Playstyle</h2>
      <p>I am known for my quick release and excellent anticipation. No other quarterback has the same pinpoint accuracy and precision that I do. While I am not very mobile, I can move around the pocket and make time for our plays to develop.</p>
